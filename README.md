3D Printer Material Prediction Using IBM Watson Studio
The 3D printing materials industry is increasing due to the rise in the demand from healthcare, automotive, and other industries, globally. The 3D printing materials market comprises several stakeholders, such as raw material suppliers, processors, end-product manufacturers, and regulatory organizations in the supply chain. The demand side of this market is characterized by the development of various industries such as aerospace & defense, healthcare, consumer goods, and automotive. Advancements in technology and diverse applications characterize the supply side. Various primary sources from both the supply and demand sides of the market were interviewed to obtain qualitative and quantitative information.

Predicting material would be more suitable for making the 3D model. In this project, the input parameters are like Layer Height (mm), Wall Thickness (mm), Infill Density (%), Infill Pattern (honeycomb, grid), Nozzle Temperature (Cº), Bed Temperature (Cº), Print Speed(mm/s), Fan Speed (%), Roughness (µm), Tension (ultimate), Strength (MPa), Elongation (%).

Based on these parameters a supervised machine learning model is built to predict the best material to be used for building 3D models. A web application is build so that the user can type in the mentioned parameters and the material which suits the best is showcased on UI.
